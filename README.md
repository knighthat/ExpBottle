    ExpBottle (Reworked)
</h1>

Withdraw your XP into bottles
</p>

# Description

This is the forked version of [ExpBottle](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/98763/) aiming to fix bugs,
improve performance, and add more features.

## What I have done

- %xp% in bottle's lore is no longer a requirement.
- Bottle's display name can be changed.
- Dispenser can throw bottle now.
- A bug where players will get unlimited XP if they use it on off-hand with 'throwable' off

# Features:

> I kept all features. In the future, maybe import new features.

- Withdraw all or a specific amount of experience into a bottle.
- Taxing (if enabled)
- Give a player your Experience Points.
- Supports dispensers.
- Custom aliases:
    * Main command
    * Sub-commands
- Changing bottle's display name
